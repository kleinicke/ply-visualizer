# Change Log

## [1.4.0] - 2025-11-??

- **Npy point clouds**: Add support for npy point clouds (dimension [...,3])
- **Collapsible File Items**: Added collapse/expand arrows to each point cloud, mesh, pose, and camera entry for cleaner UI organization
- **Resizable Panel**: Main UI panel can now be resized by dragging from the bottom edge
- **Distance Measuring**: Measure the distance between a shift double click selected point and the rotation center
- **24 bit mode**: Can convert 8 bit rgb images into 24 bit depth images to display as a point cloud

## [1.3.0] - 2025-09-16

- Add easier selection of material
- Add support for fx, fy, cx, cy, disp offset, bias and scale and inverse depth support for depth images
- Add support for different camera distortion models for depth to point cloud conversion: Pinhole + OpenCV Distortion, Fisheye + OpenCV Distortion and Fisheye Kannala-Brandt
- Option to load calibration files (experimentally)
- Improve performance (for occluded points, idle state and removing transparency by default)

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-25

- Add support for pfm depth/disparity predictions
- Add support for npy/npz depth/disparity predictions
- Add support for stl files

- Add support for pts files (Point Cloud format)
- Add support for off files (Object File Format)
- Add support for gltf/glb files (3D model formats)
- Add support for some camera position profiles
- Add support for some body pose estimations
- Easier application of translation, quaternion or angle axis.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-11
